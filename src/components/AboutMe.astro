      \My name is &lt;Joaquin Emanuel Lizarraga /&gt, but my friends call me
      Ema. I wrote my first program on a PIC using a PIC burner in C when I was
      14 years old. After that, I moved on to Arduino, building home automation
      systems and robotics with IoT. <strong
        >Now, I create applications that interact with sensors and leverage AI.</strong
      >

      Currently, I'm developing <strong>SugarSync</strong>, an app for diabetes
      control and management that enables users to read data from various sensor
      brands, track their carbohydrate intake, and maintain a comprehensive
      record accessible to their doctors.

      Among my proudest achievements is my experience during Henry's bootcamp,
      where I was elected as a Teaching Assistant. I guided and supported new
      bootcamp entrants through an intensive path to graduation, achieving a
      100% success rate. Today, I am a developer <strong
        >specializing in AI implementations</strong
      > for mobile applications, working on innovative projects that integrate AI-powered
      chat solutions, automated ticket management, and other cutting-edge technologies.
