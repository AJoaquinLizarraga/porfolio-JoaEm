    ${sparkncoProject}:\n
    In this project, I contributed to integrating an AI-powered chat solution using OpenAI and DeepSeek to automate and streamline Jira ticket management.
    The system leverages advanced natural language processing to interpret user inquiries in real time, automatically generating tickets, creating incident reports, and dispatching notifications without manual intervention.
    ${pursuitProject}:\n
      I led the development of a mobile app using React Native and Expo, which integrates Supabase for backend services and authentication.
      I also implemented a Retrieval and Augmented Generation (RAG) model with Pinecone to store personalized training and nutrition plans based on each user's personal data, all generated with an OpenAI AI model.
      The app combines AI, structured data output, and data analytics to provide personalized recommendations that optimize individual performance and overall well-being.
      In the process, I trained the team on:
      ► Generative AI model APIs, cost-based token counting, context injection, prompting structure management, and structured data output.
      ► Created embeddings and similarity functions to generate similarity recommendations and searches.
      ► Created Supabase edge functions using Deno.js and optimized them to interact with OpenAI request times.
    ${rentscapeProject}:\n
      I developed a feature within the Rentscape platform that features an AI-powered chat solution.
      This system leverages chat interaction with AI combined with function_calling and structured data output to generate accurate data as the AI obtains data with each message.
      That data is used to generate embeddings and perform Pinecone searches for the best rental properties.
      The solution offers an intuitive and personalized search experience based on a mathematical calculation, streamlining the decision-making process in the real estate market.
      In the process I instructed the team on the following:
      ► Use of AI reasoning models that allow function_calling and structured data output at the same time.
      ► Vector database management and client creation for Pinecone using Supabase's Edge functions with Deno`,
